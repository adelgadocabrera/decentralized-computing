# Ticketing Project Draft

## Main features
A layer 2 abstract layer for managing tickets for events could work as follows:

1. The event organizer would create a smart contract on the blockchain that represents the event and the available tickets. The smart contract would include information such as the name of the event, the date and time, the venue, and the number of available tickets.
<br>
2. When a user wants to purchase a ticket, they would interact with the smart contract by sending a transaction to reserve a ticket. The smart contract would deduct the ticket from the available pool and send a message to the user's layer 2 wallet that the ticket has been reserved.
<br>
3. The user's layer 2 wallet would store the reserved ticket information off-chain. This would allow the user to interact with the ticket without incurring high transaction fees on the blockchain.
<br>
4. To enter the event, the user would present their ticket to a scanner or a validator. The scanner would communicate with the blockchain to verify that the ticket is valid and has not been used before.
<br>
5. Once the ticket is validated, the user's layer 2 wallet would mark the ticket as used. This would prevent the user from using the same ticket multiple times or transferring it to another user.
<br>
6. If the user decides not to attend the event, they could cancel their reservation and release the ticket back to the available pool. The smart contract would then update the available ticket pool accordingly. The goal is to prevent tickets from being sold at a higher price than the original. 
<br>
7. The layer 2 solution could use various techniques to ensure scalability and low transaction costs. 
<br>

## Summary

**Ticketing** provides a more efficient and scalable way to handle ticket transactions on the blockchain, while also allowing users to interact with their tickets in a user-friendly way.
